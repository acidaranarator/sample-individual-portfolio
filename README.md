# sample-individual-portfolio
My first website done using HTML, CSS and Javascript when I first started learning frontend in web development.

It is a sample portfolio website of a cat named Grumpy, created for the laughs as well as for myself to learn.
Consists of a home page, work profile and a blog written in Dhivehi. The Dhivehi lorem ipsum text was generated and taken from https://faker.baivaru.net/ .
